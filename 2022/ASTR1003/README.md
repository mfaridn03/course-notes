# Week 1

## Falsifiable theories

-   Newton’s Theory of Gravity
-   Einstein General Relativity
-   Evolution
-   Big bang

Can be disproved by a single experiment

## Non-falsifiable theories

-   God
-   Universe was created 6000 years ago as a practical joke

## Scientific method

-   Do an experiment
    -   Come up with theory/theories
    -   Make prediction
    -   Carry out experiment to test prediction

If facts do not fit the theory

-   Check for experimental error
-   Other effects that may invalidate conclusion
-   Theory is wrong
    -   Revise current theory or make a new one that fits all the facts

## Evidence

-   Repeatability
-   Science is objective, while scientists aren’t

## Competing theories

-   Occam’s Razor: choose simplest theory that fits the evidence

# Week 3

## Definitions

Constellation

-   A group of celestial objects, usually stars, that forms a pattern. E.g., Orion, big dipper

Celestial poles

-   Two points in the sky where the Earth’s axis of rotation intersects the axis of rotation

Equinox

-   Time and date where length of day and night are equal

Celestial sphere

-   Imaginary sphere to which the stars are fixed to the centre of the Earth

Declination

-   How far celestial north a star is (angle)
-   **Coordinates = elevation**

Right ascension

-   Same but east/west (angle)
-   **Coordinates = azimuth**

![Declination - Wikipedia](media/78bba291fb7646a5d4eabbf5a5c4cdf6.png)

**Latitude = horizontal line**

**Longitude = vertical line**

Week 4

## Stellar parallax

-   Apparent shift of a foreground object relative to background
-   Parallax measurement can be measured on any object in the sky

![Diagram Description automatically generated](media/bc768d90cbf9476c357bdd13c262b855.png)

parallax = 1AU/D D in parsec

## Brightness

Inversely proportional to distance\^2

M = m + 5 – 5log( r )

M = absolute, m = relative magnitude, r = distance in parsec. parsec = 3.26 ly

## Motion

True motion

-   Actual motion

# Week 5

-   Used more for astronomy

Snell’s law:

**Keplerian telescopes: magnification = f0/fe (image is inverted)**

**![A picture containing text, antenna Description automatically generated](media/3cecb6261ecec2f95fa9d30fe550d23a.png)**

## Scale of Brightness

m2 – m1 = 2.5 log (bm1 / bm2) = 2.5 log (D1\^2/D2\^2)

Where m = distances, b = brightness?, D = diameter of aperture

## Images

-   Real images vs virtual images

## Angular magnification

## Chromatic aberrations

-   Different colours bend at different speed
-   Put through lens and you can see separate red/blue colours
-   Light absorbed as it travels through lens material
-   Perfect lens can be built with different glass of different refractive indexes, but very complicated and difficult

## Terms

-   Resolving power
    -   Maximum detail that can be seen through a telescope
    -   Angular measure of minimum separation of two points in sky that the object can distinguish as different objects
    -   Depends on size of primary mirror and wavelength of light

wavelength / diameter

# Week 6

Period: time for one oscillation of a wave

Frequency: how many oscillations per second

Speed = wavelength x frequency

## Black body radiation

P = A o T\^4 (P = power or luminosity)

Power (watts,) = surface area (m\^2) \* Stefan-Boltzmann Constant \* temperature (kelvin) \^ 4

## Thermal radiation

Wien’s law

Max wavelength = C / T

C is constant of proportionality![](media/272b95c051cc3ef7a7b536a515a07c8c.png)

T in kelvin

## Temperature

![](media/3682a4c971fd1a5655f0b7eaaa1318cd.png)

## Flux

Flux = Total power / 4 pi r\^2

![Text Description automatically generated](media/9b6742b79c84262c9bbb535baaf920be.png)

## Stellar lifetime

Mass also correlates with stellar lifetime

Stellar lifetime inversely proportional to stellar mass \^3

# Week 7

## Spectra

**Continuous** spectra – all wavelengths

**Emission** spectra – no wavelengths except for a few

**Absorption** spectra – all wavelengths except for a few

Spectral lines can also reveal:

-   Density of gas clouds
-   Radial motion
-   Rotational motion
-   The spread of velocity
-   Distances to other galaxies **(cosmological redshift)**
-   Magnetic field strength **(Zeeman effect)**

## Bohr model energy levels

![Diagram Description automatically generated](media/dbca95da866f9969269e65bb15bc67fe.png)

E = hc/lamda

h is planck’s constant  
c is speed of light  
lambda is wavelength  
E is energy

-   Electrons usually emit or absorb energy by interacting with photons
-   Hydrogen absorbs photons at wavelengths that correspond with energy level transition
-   Also emits photons at these wavelengths after excited state decay

## Spectral classification (racism :tf:)

# Week 8

![](media/15d35016389344acb27f45884b89b2de.png)

## Galaxy classification

Spiral, barred spiral, irregular, elliptical

![](media/bce807706087696c3128001892952296.png)![](media/8c510df7e585c98dbba3e9cbe86ec72a.png)

## Star formation

Spiral galaxies are thought to be young and have gas that can form stars

-   Gas and dust “settle” into the disk forming dark lines and clouds
-   Disturbed gas will collapse under gravity
-   Young, hot stars form in the disk, making it appear blue.
-   Older (cooler) stars in the bulge look yellow

## Trivia

Earth more abundant in elements such as Silicon and Oxygen because planetary formation concentrates heavier elements

Red dwarf is not associated with something end of star’s life cycle

Stars in galaxies that are far away from us have fewer heavy elements than nearby stars

## Protostar formation

Gravitational collapse of a vast cloud of gas and dust creates protostars

Temperature at core increases as the gas compresses

Nuclear fusion starts at core temp 10 million degrees, Hydrogen converted to Helium

**As a protostar collapse, fusion begins at the turning point of HR diagram**

![](media/d20079156db973a74a59eea7767c9a5c.png)

Most of a star’s life is on main sequence

-   While fusion continues, Iron core is crushed past the limit that electron degeneracy and pressure can support
-   Electron combine with protons to form neutron & neutrinos
-   ![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated with low confidence](media/3be394b5067c3364bd6b8dbfe2857120.png)

## Types of supernovae

-   Type I

# Week 10

## Tully-Fisher relation

-   Relationship between the mass/intrinsic luminosity of a spiral galaxy and its rotation velocity or emission line width
-   More massive spiral galaxies tend to be brighter
-   Rotation speed increase with mass

## Olber’s paradox

-   **Why is the night sky dark?**
    -   If the universe is static and infinite in extent, then every line of sight from Earth will eventually intersect the surface of a star
    -   Sky should radiate like a blackbody with temperature of thousands of Kelvin
-   We are saved if the universe has a finite age, because light from distant stars has not had time to reach us -\> **age of the universe**
-   Can’t see light from stars that are too far away
-   The further away we look, the further back in time we see, until eventually we reach a time in the early Universe when stars and galaxies had not yet formed
